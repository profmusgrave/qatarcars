## Overview

{qatarcars} provides a more internationally-focused, modern cars-based demonstration dataset. It mirrors many of the columns in `mtcars`, but uses (1) non-US-centric makes and models, (2) 2025 prices, and (3) metric measurements, making it more appropriate for use as an example dataset outside the United States. It includes almost exactly the same variables as the `mtcars` dataset:

- `origin` (the country associated with the car brand)
- `make` (the brand of the car, such as Toyota or Land Rover)
- `model` (the specific type of car, such as Land Cruiser or Defender)
- `length`, `width`, and `height` (all in meters)
- `trunk` capacity (measured in liters)
- fuel `economy` (measured in liters per 100 km)
- `performance` (time in seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h)
- `mass` in kilograms
- `price` in 2025 Qatari riyals
- `type` (the type of the car, such as coupe, sedan, or SUV)
- `enginetype` (electric, hybrid, or petrol)

The original data was compiled by [Paul Musgrave](https://paulmusgrave.info/) in January 2025 and is mostly sourced from [YallaMotors Qatar](https://qatar.yallamotor.com/). See [Paul's writeup of the background and purpose of the data](https://open.substack.com/pub/musgrave/p/introducing-the-qatar-cars-dataset); access his [original Stata data here](https://github.com/profmusgrave/qatarcars).

## Formats

The Qatar Cars data is available in several different formats:

- This R package
- Plain text CSV
- Stata .dta
- R .rds
- Python package


## Installation

The released version of {qatarcars} is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org):

```{.r}
install.packages("qatarcars")
```

You can also install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

```{.r}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("profmusgrave/qatarcars")
```


## Usage

### Load data

Similar to other data-only R packages like [{gapminder}](https://jennybc.github.io/gapminder/) and [{palmerpenguins}](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/), load the data by running `library(qatarcars)`:

```{r}
#| label: load-data

library(qatarcars)

qatarcars
```

::: {.callout-tip}
If you have [{tibble}](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) installed (likely as part of [the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)), `qatarcars` will load as a tibble with nicer printing output; if you do not have {tibble} installed, the data will load as a standard data frame.
:::


### Labels

Most columns in `qatarcars` are labelled:

```{r}
#| label: show-attributes

attributes(qatarcars$economy)
```

These labels are visible in RStudio's Viewer panel:

![](man/figures/rstudio-viewer-labels.png)

If you use {ggplot2} v4.0+, these variable labels will [automatically appear in plot labels](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2025/09/ggplot2-4-0-0/#labels):

```{r}
#| label: plot-economy-histogram
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(qatarcars, aes(x = economy)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#8A1538", color = "white")
```


## Examples

Fuel efficiency gets worse as cars get heavier:

```{r}
#| label: plot-mass-economy
#| warning: false
#| message: false

ggplot(qatarcars, aes(x = mass, y = economy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma())
```

Some of these cars are really expensive, so logging the price is helpful:

```{r}
#| label: plot-performance-price
#| message: false

ggplot(qatarcars, aes(x = performance, y = price)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_point(aes(color = type)) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::label_currency(prefix = "QR "))
```

* qatarcars.dta
* qatarcars.csv

* Relationship between files, if important: Identical data, different formats.
* Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package: NA
* Are there multiple versions of the dataset? NA

# METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

## Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 

The data was collected as part of a statistics course for International Politics majors at Georgetown University. Data was gathered from online automobile Web sites and collected via Google Forms and spreadsheets. Students were assigned automobile manufacturers and told to collect one to three makes for each manufacturer. In addition to collecting much of the data, Musgrave edited the data and ensured consistency in formatting.
