**EXTRA HIDDEN INSTRUCTIONS**

A few important notes about building, maintaining, and deploying this package:

### Documentation

- `README.md` is created with `README.qmd`. After making any changes to `README.qmd`, make sure you run this to generate a new `README.md` (note the `--default-image-extension` option---this is necessary to [prevent Quarto](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/6092#issuecomment-1618063261) from appending `.png` to the badge URLs):

  ```bash
  quarto render README.qmd --to gfm --default-image-extension ""
  ```

  or

  ```r
  quarto::quarto_render(
    "README.qmd", 
    output_format = "gfm", 
    quarto_args = c("--default-image-extension", "")
  )
  ```

- The package documentation website is built with [{altdoc}](https://altdoc.etiennebacher.com/) and Quarto. I created the skeleton with:

  ```r
  altdoc::setup_docs(tool = "quarto_website")
  ```

  The Quarto configuration files live in `altdoc/`.

- The documentation website can be built locally with:

  ```r
  altdoc::render_docs()
  altdoc::preview_docs()
  ```

  …and it'll appear in `docs/`. *However*, this folder is not tracked by version control. A GitHub action (`.github/workflows/altdoc.yaml`) builds the website with a GitHub runner and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch, so there's no need to push any website content from here to any remote server.

### Data

The canonical source of data is the Stata file at `inst/extdata/qatarcars.dta` (and at <https://qatarcars.georgetown.domains/qatarcars.dta>). If this file is ever updated, two things need to happen:

1. Run the script at `data-raw/qatarcars.R` to convert the `.dta` file to the package's internal file type, CSV, and RDS.

2. Run `testthat::snapshot_accept('data')` to update the test snapshot (`tests/testthat/test-data.R` checks the data against a saved snapshot)

Once that's all done, document, build, and check like normal (see below).

### Build

The normal workflow for updating the package is:

```r
devtools::document()
devtools::check()
devtools::load_all()
```

:::

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "man/figures/README-",
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.height = (6 * 0.618),
  fig.align = "center", 
  fig.retina = 3,
  out.width= "80%",
  dpi = 300
)
```

## Overview

Qatar Cars provides a more internationally-focused, modern cars-based demonstration dataset. It mirrors many of the columns in `mtcars`, but uses (1) non-US-centric makes and models, (2) 2025 prices, and (3) metric measurements, making it more appropriate for use as an example dataset outside the United States. It includes almost exactly the same variables as the `mtcars` dataset:

- `origin`: The country associated with the car brand
- `make` The brand of the car, such as Toyota or Land Rover
- `model` The specific type of car, such as Land Cruiser or Defender
- `length`, `width`, and `height`: Length, width, and height of the car (in meters)
- `seating`: Number of seats in the car
- `trunk`: Capacity or volume of the trunk (in liters)
- `economy`: Fuel economy of the car (in liters per 100 km)
- `horsepower`: Car horsepower
- `price`: Price of the car in 2025 Qatari riyals
- `mass`: Mass of the car (in kg)
- `performance`: Time to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (in seconds)
- `type`: The type of the car, such as coupe, sedan, or SUV
- `enginetype`: The type of engine: electric, hybrid, or petrol

The original data was compiled by [Paul Musgrave](https://paulmusgrave.info/) in January 2025 and is mostly sourced from YallaMotors Qatar. See [Paul's writeup of the background and purpose of the data](https://open.substack.com/pub/musgrave/p/introducing-the-qatar-cars-dataset). 

See this article for a more detailed description of the rationale for and process of collecting the data:

> Paul Musgrave, “Defaulting to Inclusion: Producing Sample Datasets for the Global Data Science Classroom,” *Journal of Political Science Education*, 2025, 1–11, <https://doi.org/10.1080/15512169.2025.2572320>.


## Formats

The Qatar Cars data is available in several different formats:

- **This {qatarcars} R package**. See below for complete details. Load like this:

  ```r
  library(qatarcars)
  qatarcars
  ```

- [**Plain text CSV file**](https://github.com/profmusgrave/qatarcars/blob/main/inst/extdata/qatarcars.csv). Use with any software.

- [**Stata .dta file**](https://qatarcars.georgetown.domains/qatarcars.dta). Load like this:

  ```stata
  use "https://qatarcars.georgetown.domains/qatarcars.dta"
  list in 1/6
  ```

- [**R .rds file**](https://github.com/profmusgrave/qatarcars/blob/main/inst/extdata/qatarcars.rds). Load like this:

  ```r
  df <- readRDS("qatarcars.rds")
  head(df)
  ```

- [**The QatarCars Python package**](https://github.com/prlitics/qatarcars). Install with `pip install qatarcars`, then load like this:

  ```python
  from qatarcars import get_qatar_cars
  df = get_qatar_cars("pandas")  # or "polars"
  df.head()
  ```


## Installation

The released version of {qatarcars} is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org):

```{.r}
install.packages("qatarcars")
```

You can also install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/):

```{.r}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("profmusgrave/qatarcars")
```


## Usage

### Load data

Similar to other data-only R packages like [{gapminder}](https://jennybc.github.io/gapminder/) and [{palmerpenguins}](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/), load the data by running `library(qatarcars)`:

```{r}
#| label: load-data

library(qatarcars)

qatarcars
```

::: {.callout-tip}
If you have [{tibble}](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) installed (likely as part of [the tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/)), `qatarcars` will load as a tibble with nicer printing output; if you do not have {tibble} installed, the data will load as a standard data frame.
:::

See `?qatarcars` for data documentation within R.

### Currency conversions

Prices are stored as Qatari Riyals (QAR). At the time of data collection in January 2025, the exchange rates between QAR and US Dollars and Euros were:

- 1 USD = 3.64 QAR
- 1 EUR = 4.15 QAR

For convenience, this package includes functions for converting between these three currencies based on January 2025 exchange rates:

- From QAR: `qar_to_usd()` and `qar_to_eur()`
- From USD: `usd_to_qar()` and `usd_to_eur()`
- From EUR: `eur_to_qar()` and `eur_to_usd()`

```{r}
#| label: convert-currency
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(dplyr)

qatarcars |>
  mutate(
    price_eur = qar_to_eur(price),
    price_usd = qar_to_usd(price)
  ) |>
  select(origin, make, model, starts_with("price"))
```

### Unit conversions

Conversions between SI (International System) units (i.e. meters, grams, liters) and US customary units (i.e. feet, pounds, gallons) are not included as functions. This is deliberate for pedagogical reasons. The data is designed to be universally inclusive with SI units used by the majority of the world. Users who work with US customary units can convert to them on their own.

Here's a guide to making this conversions, since not all of the variables are straightforward:

**Distance (meters ↔ feet)**

- 1 foot = 0.3048 meters ([official standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_(unit)))
- 1 meter = 3.28084 feet, or $\frac{1}{0.3048}$

**Mass (kilograms ↔ pounds)**

- 1 pound = 0.45359237 kilograms ([official standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_yard_and_pound))
- 1 kilogram = 2.204623 pounds, or $\frac{1}{0.45359237}$

**Volume (liters ↔ cubic feet)**

- 1 liter = 0.03531467 cubic feet
- 1 cubic foot = 28.31684 liters or $\frac{1}{0.03531467}$

*Note*: 1 liter = 0.001 cubic meters, so in cubic feet, 1 liter = $0.001 \times \left(\frac{1}{0.3048}\right)^3$ = 0.03531467

**Fuel economy (L/100km ↔ MPG)**

- 1 MPG = $\frac{235.215}{\text{L/100km}}$
- 1 L/100km = $\frac{235.215}{\text{MPG}}$

::: {.callout-note}
These are inverted! Higher MPG = lower L/100km. In SI units, low `economy` values are good; in US customary units, high `economy` values are good.
:::

(these are rounded values; you should use more exact values in your code):

- 1 US gallon = 231 cubic inches = 3.785411784 liters ([official standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallon#US_gallon))
- 1 mile = 1.609344 kilometers, or $\frac{0.3048 \times 5280}{1000}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{L/100km} &\rightarrow \text{MPG} \\
&= \frac{100 \text{ km}}{\text{L/100km}} \times \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{1.609 \text{ km}} \times \frac{3.785 \text{ L}}{1 \text{ gallon}}\\
&= \frac{100 \times 3.785}{1.609 \times \text{L/100km}} \times \frac{\text{ miles}}{\text{ gallon}} \\
&\approx \frac{235.215}{\text{L/100km}} \text{ MPG}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Performance (0–100 km/h ↔ 0–60 mph)**

This conversion is only approximate because 100 km/h corresponds to about 62 mph, not exactly 60 mph, and cars may not accelerate at a constant rate. For a comparable estimate, we assume constant acceleration (i.e. time is proportional to target speed).

60 mph = 96.56064 km/h ($\frac{0.3048 \times 5280 \times 60}{1000}$), so 60 mph is ≈96.56% of 100 km/h. Thus:

- 0–60 mph (s) = $\text{0–100 km/h (s)} \times 0.9656064$
- 0–100 km/h (s) = $\frac{\text{0–60 mph (s)}}{0.9656064}$

```{r}
#| label: convert-units
#| warning: false
#| message: false

economy_conversion_factor <- 100 *
  3.785411784 / # liters in a gallon
  (0.3048 * 5280 / 1000) # kilometers in a mile

performance_conversion_factor <- 0.3048 * 5280 * 60 / 1000 / 100

qatarcars |>
  mutate(
    length_ft = length / 0.3048,
    economy_mpg = economy_conversion_factor / economy,
    performance_mpg = performance * performance_conversion_factor
  ) |>
  select(make, model, length, length_ft, economy, economy_mpg, performance, performance_mpg)
```

Another benefit of not including built-in conversion functions like `m_to_ft()` is that this data can be used to teach learners how to write R functions:

```{r}
m_to_ft <- function(meters) {
  meters * (1 / 0.3048)
}

m_to_ft(100)
```

### Color

The official colors of the Qatari flag are [white and Pantone 1955 C, or "Qatar maroon."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Qatar) The hex representation of this color is `⁠#8A1538`.⁠

For convenience, this is included as `qatar_maroon`:

```{r}
#| label: show-qatar-maroon
#| fig-width: 2
#| fig-height: 2
#| out-width: "25%"

qatar_maroon

scales::show_col(qatar_maroon)
```

### Labels

Most columns in `qatarcars` are labeled:

```{r}
#| label: show-attributes

attributes(qatarcars$economy)
```

These labels are visible in RStudio's Viewer panel:

![](man/figures/rstudio-viewer-labels.png)

If you use {ggplot2} v4.0+, these variable labels will [automatically appear in plot labels](https://tidyverse.org/blog/2025/09/ggplot2-4-0-0/#labels):

```{r}
#| label: plot-economy-histogram
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(qatarcars, aes(x = economy)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = qatar_maroon, color = "white")
```

The various conversion functions also update the labels:

```{r}
#| label: plot-price-eur

qatarcars |> 
  mutate(price_eur = qar_to_eur(price)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = price_eur)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = qatar_maroon, color = "white")  +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_currency(prefix = "€"))
```


## Examples

Fuel efficiency gets worse as cars get heavier:

```{r}
#| label: plot-mass-economy
#| warning: false
#| message: false

ggplot(qatarcars, aes(x = mass, y = economy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma())
```

This is reversed when looking at miles per gallon. In SI units, low `economy` values are good; in US customary units, high `economy` values are good:

```{r}
#| label: plot-mass-economy-us
#| warning: false
#| message: false

economy_conversion_factor <- 100 *
  3.785411784 / # liters in a gallon
  (0.3048 * 5280 / 1000) # kilometers in a mile

qatarcars |> 
  mutate(
    mass_lbs = mass / 0.45359237,
    economy_mph = economy_conversion_factor / economy
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = mass_lbs, y = economy_mph)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_comma()) +
  labs(x = "Mass (lbs)", y = "Fuel Economy (mpg)")
```

Some of these cars are really expensive, so logging the price is helpful:

```{r}
#| label: plot-performance-price
#| message: false

ggplot(qatarcars, aes(x = performance, y = price)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_point(aes(color = type)) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::label_currency(prefix = "QR "))
```

Or in dollars:

```{r}
#| label: plot-performance-price-usd
#| message: false

qatarcars |> 
  mutate(
    price_usd = qar_to_usd(price),
    performance_mph = performance * (0.3048 * 5280 * 60 / 1000 / 100)
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = performance_mph, y = price_usd)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_point(aes(color = type)) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::label_currency(prefix = "$")) +
  labs(x = "Time 0-60 mph (s)")
```
